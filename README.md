## TMRL -- [Github Link](https://github.com/trackmania-rl/tmrl)

The [gym](https://github.com/yannbouteiller/rtgym) is directly run which simulates the bots interaction with the environmetn with a [rollout worker](https://medium.com/@sophiezhao_2990/rollout-in-rl-how-its-structured-ca6c106cfc80)
> A "rollout worker" in reinforcement learning (RL) is a component that simulates an agent's interaction with an environment to collect data for training, often using a specific policy to generate experience trajectories.

The [inputs](https://github.com/trackmania-rl/tmrl/blob/master/tmrl/custom/tm/utils/control_gamepad.py) are controlled by simulating an analog controller
